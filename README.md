# Parkinson's Disease Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease based on patient data. Using the Gradient Boosting Classifier and SMOTE to address class imbalance, the model achieves an accuracy between 75% and 80%, making it a promising tool for early disease detection.

## üöÄ Overview

Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict the presence of Parkinson's disease. 

## üß† Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing data, scales features using `StandardScaler`, and addresses class imbalance with SMOTE.
- **Modeling**: Utilizes a Gradient Boosting Classifier to make predictions, which is known for its accuracy and robustness in handling imbalanced datasets.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports to ensure reliable performance.
- **Visualization**: Provides insightful visualizations like feature importance plots, correlation heatmaps, and target variable distributions.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains patient data, including various biomedical voice measurements, and a target variable `status` that indicates whether the patient has Parkinson's disease.

- **Source**: [Parkinson's Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**: Explore the dataset with initial statistics and visualizations.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Remove irrelevant columns.
   - Standardize the feature space.
   - Handle class imbalance using SMOTE.
3. **Model Training**: Train the Gradient Boosting Classifier on the processed data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Use accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and classification report to evaluate performance.
5. **Visualization**: Plot feature importance and correlation heatmaps for a deeper understanding of the data.

##Key Tasks

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Scaling
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- Gradient Boosting Classifier for prediction
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backbone of the project.
- **pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and evaluation.
- **SMOTE (imbalanced-learn)**: To handle class imbalance.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: For data visualization.

## üìà Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: The model achieves an accuracy of 75% to 80%.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows the performance of the classification model by displaying the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
- **Feature Importance**: Visualization of the features most influential in predicting Parkinson's disease.
